# Introduction

Dynamic Models and Bayesian Forecasting were introduced in the seminal work by
Harrison (1976). Since then, many scientists do seem to have an interest in the
theoretical innovations and practical applications of this technique. 

Two major works in the field of dynamic models are  West and Harrison (1986)
and West and Harrison (1989), in which the authors introduced Bayesian
subjective intervention, automatic monitoring, and adaptation in the class of 
Dynamic Linear Model (DLM).

To our knowledge, there is no open source tool for Bayesian monitoring and
intervention despite the software literature offering a variety of programs to
work with state space models.
To fill this gap, we introduce `pybats-detection` package, an effective
**python** package for the identification of structural changes and outliers
in DLM. The package's current version includes smoothing for univariate DLM,
automatic monitoring, and subjective intervention.


```{r smooth, child = "01__smooth.Rmd"}
```

```{r intervention, child = "02__manual_intervention.Rmd"}
```

```{r monitor, child = "03__automatic_monitor.Rmd"}
```
